# Flarum Lang
We all love our Flarum and its vastly existing ecosystem. One part of that is the many different language packs that are available. One of the major challenges of an Open Source project is ensuring longevity. As of right now, language packs are tied to single persons (and their respective repositories). If one of those awesome people maintaining their language pack becomes unavailable, this means the repository changes. Therefore all users of this language pack need to change something as well.

In consequence, the Flarum-lang (https://github.com/flarum-lang) initiative has been launched by luceos. What's the objective? Hosting all language packs on this (un)-official repository so that they are available for all end-users under a consistent package even if at some stage the contributors may change.
